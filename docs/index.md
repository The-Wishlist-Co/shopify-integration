The Wishlist — a product of The Wishlist Company — provides retailers with a hosted wishlist solution that can be shared between their brick-and-mortar stores and online storefronts.

The initial implementation of The Wishlist provides integration with Shopify online storefronts.  Additional solutions will be added later.

This documentation focuses on the integration with Shopify.

## Accessing the Shopify configuration for The Wishlist

The steps below show how to access the wishlist configuration for your Shopify store.

1. Log into your Shopify store.
2. In the menu on the left-hand-side of the page, select the “Apps” item.
3. A small popup will be displayed showing the list of applications that have been installed in your online store. Select “Wishlist”.
